# Agile Methodology in SDLC

## 📌 Introduction
Agile methodology in **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is an iterative and flexible approach to software development. Unlike traditional models like **Waterfall**, Agile focuses on **continuous delivery, customer collaboration, and quick adaptability to change**.

---

## 🚀 Key Principles of Agile
1. **Iterative Development** – Software is developed in **small cycles** called **sprints** (typically 1-4 weeks).
2. **Customer Collaboration** – Customers and stakeholders are actively involved to provide continuous feedback.
3. **Continuous Improvement** – After each sprint, the team reviews progress and improves.
4. **Flexibility** – Requirements can evolve, and the team adapts accordingly.
5. **Self-Organizing Teams** – Development teams work independently with less hierarchy and more teamwork.

## 🔄 Agile Workflow in SDLC
Agile follows a cycle that repeats until the final product is ready:

1. **Concept & Planning** – Define high-level goals and priorities.
2. **Design & Development** – Develop in small iterations (**sprints**).
3. **Testing & Feedback** – After each sprint, testing is done, and feedback is collected.
4. **Deployment** – Features are released in phases.
5. **Review & Repeat** – The process continues, improving each time.

## 🔹 Agile Frameworks
Agile can be implemented using different frameworks:

### ✅ Scrum
- Uses **sprints** (time-boxed development cycles).
- Daily stand-up meetings for tracking progress.
- A **Scrum Master** facilitates the process.

### ✅ Kanban
- Uses **visual boards** to track tasks.
- Focuses on **continuous delivery** with minimal bottlenecks.

### ✅ Extreme Programming (XP)
- Prioritizes **high-quality coding** with frequent releases.
- Encourages **pair programming** and **test-driven development (TDD)**.

## 🔍 Agile vs. Waterfall
| Feature        | Agile        | Waterfall    |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Development Approach | Iterative & Incremental | Linear & Sequential |
| Flexibility | High | Low |
| Customer Involvement | Continuous | Limited to initial & final stages |
| Testing | Continuous | After development is completed |
| Risk Handling | Adaptive | Rigid |

## 📖 Example Scenario
Imagine you are developing a **mobile app**:
- **Waterfall:** You complete the full design, then develop, then test, and finally launch.
- **Agile:** You build a **basic version (MVP)** first, get user feedback, improve it, and keep adding features **iteratively**.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
Agile is widely used in modern software development because it **improves efficiency, enhances product quality, and keeps customers involved throughout the process**. It is particularly useful for **startups, fast-changing projects, and software requiring frequent updates**.
