# **Closures in JavaScript â€“ A Brief Guide**  

## **What is a Closure?**  
A **closure** is a function that **remembers the variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing**.  

### **Example:**
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let count = 0; // Local variable (lexical scope)

    return function innerFunction() { // Closure
        count++; 
        console.log(count);
    };
}

const increment = outerFunction();
increment(); // Output: 1
increment(); // Output: 2
increment(); // Output: 3
```
ðŸ”¹ **Why does this work?**  
Even though `outerFunction` has finished executing, the `innerFunction` still has access to `count` because of **closure**.

## **Key Features of Closures**  
1. **Functions Remember Their Lexical Scope**  
   - A function **remembers** variables from the function where it was created.
  
2. **Closures Help in Data Encapsulation**  
   - They can be used to create **private variables** that can't be accessed from outside.

3. **Closures Keep Data Alive**  
   - Normally, local variables disappear after a function call.  
   - Closures prevent this by keeping a reference to the variables.

---

## **Common Use Cases of Closures**  

### **1. Data Encapsulation (Private Variables)**
Closures allow us to **hide variables from the outside**.
```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0; // Private variable

    return {
        increment: () => console.log(++count),
        decrement: () => console.log(--count)
    };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment(); // Output: 1
counter.increment(); // Output: 2
counter.decrement(); // Output: 1
```
ðŸ”¹ **Here, `count` is private**â€”it cannot be accessed directly.

---

### **2. Function Factories (Custom Functions)**
Closures allow us to create **customized functions**.
```javascript
function createMultiplier(factor) {
    return num => num * factor; // Closure
}

const double = createMultiplier(2);
const triple = createMultiplier(3);

console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
console.log(triple(5)); // Output: 15
```
ðŸ”¹ Each function (`double`, `triple`) **remembers `factor` from its own scope**.

---

### **3. Maintaining State in Event Listeners**
```javascript
function attachEventHandler() {
    let count = 0; // Closure variable

    document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function() {
        count++;
        console.log(`Button clicked ${count} times`);
    });
}

attachEventHandler();
```
ðŸ”¹ Even after `attachEventHandler()` executes, **the event listener still has access to `count`**.

---

### **4. Delaying Execution (setTimeout)**
```javascript
function delayedMessage(message, delay) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(message);
    }, delay);
}

delayedMessage("Hello, after 2 seconds!", 2000);
```
ðŸ”¹ The arrow function inside `setTimeout` **remembers `message`** even after `delayedMessage` has executed.

---

## **Closures and Memory Management**
Since closures keep references to outer variables, **they can cause memory leaks** if not handled properly.  
ðŸ”¹ **Solution:** Set unused variables to `null` if they are no longer needed.

---

## **Summary**
âœ… **Closures occur when an inner function remembers variables from its outer function even after the outer function has finished execution.**  
âœ… Used for **data encapsulation, function factories, event handlers, setTimeout, and maintaining state.**  
âœ… Be mindful of **memory leaks** caused by closures holding onto variables longer than needed.
